\begin{exampleblock}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gaussian Processes offer a versatile framework for building statistical models of physical models.
\item Main assumptions: the phenomenon is Gaussian, functional choice of covariance function (kernel).
\item Knowledge transfer from the physical to the statistical model: through data + expertise guiding 
the choice of kernel.
\item Complementary to the physical model, useful for decision making.
\end{itemize}
